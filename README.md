# Welcome to the SecureDrop UX Wiki 

This repo is only a wiki, and is the place for active or interested contributors to SecureDrop's experience design and user research efforts to collaborate. This is also our resource for all contributors to learn more about the human needs SecureDrop has been (and is actively being) shaped to serve. [**Get started**](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-ux/wiki)

Are you a developer looking for our [Styleguide](https://uracreative.github.io/securedrop-styleguide/)? It's currently a work-in-progress... but, there it is! <3 to Ura Design and Open Tech Fund for making it possible.

### Please never, ever, post information about specific SecureDrop users to this public wiki.
