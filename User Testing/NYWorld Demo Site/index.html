                        SecureDrop is a tool that enables secure and <b>anonymous</b> communication between sources (you!) and our journalists. As a source, you can send messages or submit documents through our SecureDrop, and receive follow-up questions from our journalists. You will only be known to our journalists through an assigned codename. No other information tied to you is required.
                  </div>
                  <p>
                     SecureDrop is not a cloud service; it is hosted by the <i>New York World</i>. To protect your anonymity, SecureDrop was built to only be accessed through the Tor network, which we will guide you on using, below.
                  <p>
                     To learn more about how data is shared and used when you use our SecureDrop, please read our <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="privacy-link">Privacy Policy</a>.

                  <h3>Before you begin</h3>
                  To protect your anonymity when using SecureDrop, it is essential that you do not use a network or device that can easily be traced back to your real identity. Instead, use public wifi networks and devices you control.
                  <ul>
                     <li><span class="green"><strong>DO</strong> access SecureDrop on a network not associated with you</span>, like the Wi-Fi at a library or cafe.
                     <li><span class="red">Do <strong>NOT</strong></span> access SecureDrop on your employer’s network.
                     <li><span class="red">Do <strong>NOT</strong></span> access SecureDrop using your employer’s hardware.
                     <li><span class="red">Do <strong>NOT</strong></span> access SecureDrop on your home network.
                  </ul>

                     Find a place to work at a public library or at a cafe that has a wifi network you can use without creating an account. Make sure your screen is out of view from security cameras and onlookers, before you begin.

                     When you make your first submission, you will receive a unique codename. Memorize it. If you write it down, be sure to destroy the copy as soon as you’ve committed it to memory.

                  <h3>Your safety matters</h3>
                  No technology can guarantee your security or anonymity. The operational security choices you make when using any technology play a significant role. Below are some best practices we recommend following.
                  <ul>
                     <li>Do not <strong>ever</strong> discuss leaking or whistleblowing, even with trusted contacts.
                     <li>You can use a unique computer you’ve designated specifically to handle sharing sensitive information. Or, you can boot your computer from an external drive using an operating system like Tails, which boots from a USB stick and erases your activity at the end of every session.
                     <li>Each file contains valuable metadata about its source — when it was created and downloaded, what machine was involved, the machine’s owner, etc. You can scrub metadata from some files prior to submission using the Metadata Anonymization Toolkit featured in Tails.
                     <li>
                        Take great care to think about what your online behavior might reveal, and consider using Tor Browser to mitigate monitoring by third parties.
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                     Our organization retains strict access control over our SecureDrop. Only a select few journalists within our organization have access to our SecureDrop. We control the servers that store your submissions, so no third party has direct access to the metadata or content of what you send us.
