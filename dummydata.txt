Hello: I’m a nurse at one of the trauma centers in town. We’ve had many patients in the last several months, all with similar/mysterious respiratory issues. My staff has noticed that most live down-wind from the Dole fields West of 696. Some of the patients say they have complained to local authorities about sewage smells. One said she’s spotted a truck spraying a sludge of some kind, on the fields at night. I’m attaching a video from the patient who taped the trucks, and a PDF of redacted police reports that other patients shared. I don’t know if there’s much you can do, but if there is I would be happy to help.

I work at the City Water Department, and a man named Reggie Esters is one of our board directors. I believe Reggie is related to Rep Monica Conyers. He’s literally never here, and the resume on file for him makes no sense. I have a hunch he is not in his job legitimately, and think you should look into this. Also: someone I work with heard him on the phone once, talking about his “time” at Jackson—that contradicts his resume. It really seems fishy.

This is a video from cameras hidden in custodial carts, at the Tyson factory on 80. The workers are shown crawling inside operating machinery, spraying chemicals without any ventilation, and numerous other safety hazards. Two appear to be children. All of this is against OSHA; none of the workers appear to speak English. Many labor and human rights laws have been rumored in town to be “overlooked” by Tyson, for some years. We feel this could make a great story.

To whom it may concern: The Feds are out to get us. On street-posts everywhere, there’s cameras. HUNDREDS OF THEM!!! I have attached pictures. Every street downtown. This is violating my First Amendment rights, under the 4th clause of the 5th participle. Also, STREET LIGHTS! VERY important, the public deserves to know. I will await a response.

Hi. Attached are files I discovered in my grandfather’s attic. They show research conducted on Agent Orange in 1962. Many passive casualties un-reported.

Hello: I read your story on Sally Dale, and her lawsuit against the St. Joseph’s Orphanage. My great-aunt was one of the nuns there. She is willing to be interviewed, but does not want her name, location, or any identity details released. She feels horrible. She wants the children who survived to find peace. Thanks.

These are documents from last week’s State hiring audit. They’re not redacted. I think the missing funds need to be written about. Thanks.

I wrote earlier about my great aunt and your Sally Dale story. She still would like to talk, but her identity must be kept private. She sent me these photos, yesterday. Papers, mostly. Some staff photos from 1957 and 1959, too.
